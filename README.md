# Logic Gates

Visualization engine for simple logic gates circuits

TODO:

-- in addWiring: fix this.getIdByGameObject(io1); returning undefined beacuse we didn't add gate IOs to gameObjectsMap
-- can connect multiple wires to IOs and should propagate to all of them (next step)
-- move wires when moving gate
-- populate toolbox with saved gates
-- fix: when connecting wire to output, propagate immediatelly
-- fix not perfect alignment of IOs (using Settings.CANVAS_WIDTH/HEIGTH)

-   add possibility of removing gates, wiring, etc.
    -- buttons visuals
    -   change cursor to trash when deleting
-   save current circuit to gate
-   name circuit
-   make many wiring attachments possible
-   fix window resizing issues
-   updat Rect, Circle classes to use new Mouse
