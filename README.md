# Logic Gates

Visualization engine for simple logic gates circuits

TODO:

-   in addWiring: fix this.getIdByGameObject(io1); returning undefined beacuse we didn't add gate IOs to gameObjectsMap
-   can connect multiple wires to IOs and should propagate to all of them (next step)
-   move wires when moving gate
-   fix window resizing issues
-   fix not perfect alignment of IOs (using Settings.CANVAS_WIDTH/HEIGTH)
-   save current circuit to gate
-   name circuit
-   populate toolbox with saved gates
